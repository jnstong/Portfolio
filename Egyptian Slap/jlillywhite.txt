NOT IMPLEMENTED
---------------

1. Card Count Labels (I'm currently trying to think of a scalable way to do this, text doesn't like scaling and accounting for playerName variables
causes for some mess with regards to how things are positioned in one browser let alone four)

2. SERVER Determined Cards (Currently awaiting outside code, pseudo code is commented in misc.js)

3. SERVER Player and Opponent Labels (Currently awaiting outside code, I need a good solution for issue 1 to get pseudocode)

4. Visual Audio Toggle (Audio toggle works, I'll probably implement a visual aspect to show the state of the toggle, not a necessity)

NOTE:
-----
misc.js could probably be split up as needed.
misc.js will need to become misc.php in order to make the php call <?php echo json_encode(serverDiscardPileArr); ?>
CSS Mobile Scaling is finnicky and doesn't seem to like to work half the time.
I renamed generic named variables such as 'i' to 'cardCount' to make code more easily readable, this might've caused errors
I'll try and fix any rename errors before pushing, but thought I'd let you know.
Various images were added
A sound file was added
images "DECKPNG" folder was renamed to "DeckPNG", not sure why I did it but make sure yours matches otherwise the card graphics wont work.

a2.html was renamed to game.html (a more appropriate name)
home.html was created (realistically this is more of a data entry page than a main page, may change in the future.)
